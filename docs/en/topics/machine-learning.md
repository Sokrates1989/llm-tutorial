# 🧠 Core Concepts

## 🔢 Regression

**Goal**: Predicting a continuous value.  
**Example**: Forecasting revenue based on purchasing power.  
**Purpose**: Basis for data-driven decisions, e.g., in marketing or controlling.

## 🏷️ Classification

**Goal**: Assigning labeled data to predefined groups.  
**Example**: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product.  
**Purpose**: Central method in online marketing, for audience targeting or fraud detection.

## 🧩 Clustering

**Goal**: Structured grouping of unlabeled data points.  
**Example**: Creating customer segments without prior labels.  
**Purpose**: Identifying patterns to optimize offers or content.

## 🗣️ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Goal**: Processing and interpreting natural language.  
**Examples**:
- Extracting email addresses from text
- Automatic text understanding  
**Recent developments**: Question-answer systems, semantic analysis, and large language models.

## 📚 Overview of Problem Types

The following problem types are typically distinguished in machine learning:

- **Regression** – Predicting continuous values  
- **Classification** – Assigning to categories  
- **Clustering** – Unsupervised grouping  
- **NLP** – Working with natural language

Each of these categories requires specific algorithms and approaches, selected and trained depending on the context.

# 🚀 Summary

✅ **Regression** enables numerical prediction of future values.  
✅ **Classification** sorts data into predefined categories.  
✅ **Clustering** detects groups in unlabeled datasets.  
✅ **NLP** enables machines to work with human language.  
✅ **The choice of algorithm depends on the problem type.**
